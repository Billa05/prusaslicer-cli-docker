Usage: prusa-slicer [ INPUT ] [ OPTIONS ] [ ACTIONS ] [ TRANSFORM ] [ file.stl ... ]

Input:
 --load ABCD         Load configuration from the specified file. It can be used more than once to
                     load options from multiple files.
 --material-profile ABCD
                     Name(s) of the material preset(s) used for slicing. Could be filaments or
                     sla_material preset name(s) depending on printer tochnology

                     This version of PrusaSlicer may not understand configurations produced by the
                     newest PrusaSlicer versions. For example, newer PrusaSlicer may extend the list
                     of supported firmware flavors. One may decide to bail out or to substitute an
                     unknown value with a default silently or verbosely. (disable, enable,
                     enable_silent; default: enable)

 --single-instance   If enabled, the command line arguments are sent to an existing instance of GUI
                     PrusaSlicer, or an existing PrusaSlicer window is activated. Overrides the
                     "single_instance" configuration value from application preferences.
 --threads N         Sets the maximum number of threads the slicing process will use. If not defined,
                     it will be decided automatically.

Print options are processed in the following order:

 --area-fill N       The value is expressed as a percentage of the bed area. If the area of a
                     particular layer is smaller than 'area_fill', then 'Below area fill threshold'
                     parameters are used to determine the layer separation (tearing) procedure.

                     back to the specified offset. A greater closing distance makes the interior more
                     rounded. At zero, the interior will resemble the exterior the most. (mm,

                     artifacts. (default: 0.5)
Layers and Perimeters:
 --layer-height N    This setting controls the height (and thus the total number) of the
                     slices/layers. Thinner layers give better accuracy but take more time to print.
                     (mm, default: 0.3)
Pad:
 --pad-around-object Create pad around object and ignore the support elevation
 --pad-around-object-everywhere

 --pad-brim-size N   How far should the pad extend around the contained geometry (mm, default: 1.6)
 --pad-enable        Add a pad underneath the supported model
 --pad-max-merge-distance N
                     Some objects can get along with a few smaller pads instead of a single big one.
                     This parameter defines how far the center of two smaller pads should be. If
                     theyare closer, they will get merged into one pad. (mm, default: 50)
 --pad-object-connector-penetration N
                     How much should the tiny connectors penetrate into the model body. (mm, default:

 --pad-object-connector-stride N
                     Distance between two connector sticks which connect the object and the generated

                     Width of the connector sticks which connect the object and the generated pad.
                     (mm, default: 0.5)
 --pad-object-gap N  The gap between the object bottom and the generated pad in zero elevation mode.
                     (mm, default: 1)
 --pad-wall-height N Defines the pad cavity depth. Set to zero to disable the cavity. Be careful when
                     enabling this feature, as some resins may produce an extreme suction effect
                     inside the cavity, which makes peeling the print off the vat foil difficult.
                     (mm, default: 0)
 --pad-wall-slope N  The slope of the pad wall relative to the bed plane. 90 degrees means straight
                     walls. (Â°, default: 90)
 --pad-wall-thickness N
                     The thickness of the pad and its optional cavity walls. (mm, default: 2)
Supports:
 --branchingsupport-base-diameter N
                     Diameter in mm of the pillar base (mm, default: 4)
 --branchingsupport-base-height N
                     The height of the pillar base cone (mm, default: 1)
 --branchingsupport-base-safety-distance N
                     The minimum distance of the pillar base from the model in mm. Makes sense in
                     zero elevation mode where a gap according to this parameter is inserted between
                     the model and the pad. (mm, default: 1)
 --branchingsupport-buildplate-only
                     Only create support if it lies on a build plate. Don't create support on a
                     print.
 --branchingsupport-critical-angle N
                     The default angle for connecting support sticks and junctions. (Â°, default: 45)
 --branchingsupport-head-front-diameter N
                     Diameter of the pointing side of the head (mm, default: 0.4)
 --branchingsupport-head-penetration N

 --branchingsupport-head-width N
                     Width from the back sphere center to the front sphere center (mm, default: 1)
 --branchingsupport-max-bridge-length N

 --branchingsupport-max-pillar-link-distance N
                     The max distance of two pillars to get linked with each other. A zero value will
                     prohibit pillar cascading. (mm, default: 10)
 --branchingsupport-max-weight-on-model N
                     Maximum weight of sub-trees that terminate on the model instead of the print
                     bed. The weight is the sum of the lenghts of all branches emanating from the
                     endpoint. (mm, default: 10)
 --branchingsupport-object-elevation N
                     How much the supports should lift up the supported object. If "Pad around
                     object" is enabled, this value is ignored. (mm, default: 5)
 --branchingsupport-pillar-diameter N
                     Diameter in mm of the support pillars (mm, default: 1)
 --branchingsupport-pillar-widening-factor N
                     Merging bridges or pillars into another pillars can increase the radius. Zero
                     means no increase, one means full increase. The exact amount of increase is
                     unspecified and can change in the future. (default: 0.5)
 --branchingsupport-small-pillar-diameter-percent
                     The percentage of smaller pillars compared to the normal pillar diameter which
                     are used in problematic areas where a normal pilla cannot fit. (%, default: 50%)
 --support-base-diameter N
                     Diameter in mm of the pillar base (mm, default: 4)
 --support-base-height N
                     The height of the pillar base cone (mm, default: 1)
 --support-base-safety-distance N
                     The minimum distance of the pillar base from the model in mm. Makes sense in
